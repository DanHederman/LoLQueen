# LoLQueen
.net &amp; Frameworks group project 
For this project we are hoping to create a WPF Application which will retrieve data from League of Legends API and their database and then 
we will display this information to the user in an attractive fashion over a GUI.
The user will be allowed to search any username and this will return the statistics desired.
